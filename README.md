Welcome to the NC News frontend project! This application is designed to provide users with access to news articles, comments, topics, and user information through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. It interacts with the NC News API, which is a backend service built using Node.js and PostgreSQL.

## Project Description

The NC News frontend project serves as a user interface for accessing the various endpoints provided by the NC News API. It allows users to view articles, read and post comments, explore different topics, and more. The frontend is built using modern web technologies like React, providing a responsive and engaging experience to users.

## Technologies Used

The NC News Frontend Project is built using the following tech stack to deliver a seamless user experience:

-   **React:** This widely adopted JavaScript library empowers us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently.

-   **Vite:** A lightning-fast build tool that enhances development speed and optimizes the performance of modern web applications.

-   **Axios:** A powerful and widely-used HTTP client that simplifies making API requests, facilitating seamless communication with the backend.

-   **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets are used to craft visually appealing and responsive designs, ensuring an engaging user interface.

    -   **Flexbox** is utilized to create flexible and adaptive layouts for the website. This allows components to automatically adjust and rearrange themselves based on the available screen space, ensuring consistent and visually appealing designs on various devices.

    -   **Media Queries** are employed to apply specific styles based on the user's device properties. With Media Queries, the website adapts its appearance, font sizes, margins, and other elements to provide an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
